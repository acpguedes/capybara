# Capybara Documentation

This directory captures the technical plan and operating guides that support the Capybara browser extension. Start with the architecture overview, then dive into the synchronization protocol, UX standards, and operational runbooks as needed.

- [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
- [Synchronization Protocol](sync/protocol.md)
- [UX Reference](ux/experience.md)
- [Operations Playbook](operations/runbook.md)

Each document is intentionally scoped so contributors can evolve the implementation without losing sight of the broader product vision.
